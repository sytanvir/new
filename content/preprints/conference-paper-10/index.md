abstract:  When fossil fuel supplies can no longer be replenished and hence fossil fuel power generation
 becomes outdated, wind energy will become a vital solution to the impending energy crisis. A
 horizontal-axis wind turbine is a widely used technology that is highly dependent on the design of
 high-performing airfoils. In this paper, we have studied the performance of the NACA6309 airfoil
 and designed it by modifying the airfoil with a trailing edge plain flap. Computational Fluid Dynamic
 (CFD) simulations are utilized for this purpose. We have designed sixteen configurations of NACA
 6309 airfoil by using plain flaps at the trailing edge and studied their aerodynamic performance.
 After comparing the lift, drag, and lift-to-drag ratios, it is evident that the 1◦ up-flap configuration
 generates the best output. In addition, the 10◦ down flap provides the worst performance among all
 configurations. Finally, pressure contours and velocity contours around the airfoils are presented,
 which describe the overall characteristics

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This study uses CFD simulations to analyze 16 configurations of the NACA6309 airfoil with trailing-edge flaps, finding that a 1° up-flap offers the best aerodynamic performance while the 10° down-flap performs the worst.
